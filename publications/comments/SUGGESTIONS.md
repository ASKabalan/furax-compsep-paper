```

### **Fix 6**: Line 359 - PTEP Reference

```latex
The noise vector \( \mathbf{n} \) is sampled as Gaussian white noise, scaled to match LiteBIRD-like polarization depth across the frequency channels.

## 3. Content Clarifications

### **Fix 7**: Line 224 - Explore Other Loss Functions
**Comment**: `\je{We should probably say we explore other loss functions as well}`

**Current location**: After equation (15) discussing variance minimization

**Add new paragraph**:
```latex
Although the variance of the reconstructed CMB and the total $\sum C_\ell^{BB}$ power are effective proxies for assessing residual contamination in the output CMB maps, we also explored alternative loss functions during model selection. These included direct minimization of systematic residuals, weighted combinations of statistical and systematic metrics, and direct optimization of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ estimation uncertainty. However, the variance-based approach consistently provided the most robust and computationally efficient selection criterion across different sky regions and noise realizations.
```

### **Fix 8**: Line 295 - Paragraph Formatting
**Comment**: `\je{this probably does not deserve a numbered paragraph}`

**Current text**:
```latex
\paragraph{BB Spectrum Convention.}
All angular power spectra are reported in the standard units:
```

**Replace with**:
```latex
\subsubsection*{BB Spectrum Convention}
All angular power spectra are reported in the standard units:
```

### **Fix 9**: Line 597 - Single-patch Definition
**Comment**: `\je{to be introduced maybe, I think this is the first time it appears}`

**Current text** (first mention of single-patch):
```latex
We assess the quality of CMB reconstruction achieved by the three spatial modeling strategies: single-patch, multi-resolution, and K-means clustering.
```

**Replace with**:
```latex
We assess the quality of CMB reconstruction achieved by three spatial modeling strategies: single global patch (where all spectral parameters are uniform across the sky), multi-resolution grouping, and K-means clustering.
```

### **Fix 10**: Line 689 - Reference Missing Figure
**Comment**: `\je{I don't think this figure was referred to nor commented in the main text -- I think this is an important result!}`

**Add to text before Figure \ref{fig:r_likelihood_distribution} around line 650**:
```latex
Figure~\ref{fig:r_likelihood_distribution} shows the resulting tensor-to-scalar ratio likelihood distributions, which represent one of our key findings. The K-means clustering approach yields the most accurate and precise measurement, with a likelihood distribution narrowly centered around the true $r$ value.
```

# ðŸŸ¢ FIGURE MODIFICATIONS - Code Changes in `content/09-R_estimation.py`

## 4. Legend and Labeling Improvements

### **Fix 11**: Line 641 - Improve Figure Legend Names
**Comment**: `\je{can you find more explicit naming? for KMeans MultiRes_1/2 since this is the figure that people will take out of context when refering to your work ...)} \je{maybe "This work (optimal Kmeans technique)" or something like that ? with a red color ? for KMeans}`

**File**: `content/09-R_estimation.py`
**Function**: `plot_all_cl_residuals()` (lines ~836-865)

**Current code**:
```python
plt.plot(
    ell_range,
    cl_pytree["cl_syst_res"] * coeff,
    label=rf"{name} $C_\ell^{{\mathrm{{syst}}}}$",
    color=color,
    linestyle="-",
)
```

[MY_COMMENT] : This is not How I generate the names This is how 

```bash
python content/09-R_estimation.py -r BS500 PTEP1 PTEP3 -t KMEANS_TITLE MULTIRES_1_TITLE MULTIRES_2_TITLE`
```

KMeans title should be something like "This work etc .." or ourwork
The others should be be the nsides MultiRes MODELS (1) and MultiRes MODELS (2) in file content/99-run_all_jobs.sh

**Replace with**:
```python
# Define better names mapping
name_mapping = {
    "KMeans": "This work (K-means clustering)",
    "MultiRes": "Multi-resolution baseline", 
    "MultiRes_1": "Multi-resolution (config 1)",
    "MultiRes_2": "Multi-resolution (config 2)",
    "Single": "Single global patch"
}
display_name = name_mapping.get(name, name)

# Use specific colors
color_mapping = {
    "This work (K-means clustering)": "red",
    "Multi-resolution baseline": "blue",
    "Multi-resolution (config 1)": "blue", 
    "Multi-resolution (config 2)": "green",
    "Single global patch": "gray"
}
plot_color = color_mapping.get(display_name, color)

plt.plot(
    ell_range,
    cl_pytree["cl_syst_res"] * coeff,
    label=rf"{display_name} $C_\ell^{{\mathrm{{syst}}}}$",
    color=plot_color,
    linestyle="-",
    linewidth=2 if "This work" in display_name else 1,
)
```

### **Fix 12**: Line 390 - Add Error Bars to Validation Plot
**Comment**: `\je{could you add error bars corresponding to the scatter of the map variance across noise simulations ?}`

**File**: `content/09-R_estimation.py`
**Function**: Modify validation plotting (around lines 740-796 in `plot_all_variances()`)

**Add after line ~758**:
```python
# Calculate error bars (standard deviation across noise realizations)
variance_values = get_all_variances(cmb_pytree["cmb_recon"])
variance_mean = np.mean(variance_values)
variance_std = np.std(variance_values)

# When plotting histograms, add error bars to mean lines
ax.axvline(variance_mean, color=color, linestyle="--", linewidth=2, 
          label=f"Mean Â± Ïƒ of {name}")
ax.axvspan(variance_mean - variance_std, variance_mean + variance_std, 
          color=color, alpha=0.2)
```

[MY_COMMENT]
WRONG this is not this file that generates all of this stuff
it is in `content/02-validation-model.py`
functions plot_cmb_nll_vs_B_d_patches in file `data/plotting.py`


### **Fix 13**: Line 629 - Fix r=1 vs r=0.001 Inconsistency
**Comment**: `\je{you used r=0.001 in the figure}`

**File**: `content/09-R_estimation.py`
**Function**: `plot_all_cl_residuals()` (lines ~813-814)

**Current code**:
```python
plt.plot(
    ell_range,
    cl_bb_r1 * coeff * 1e-3,
    label=r"$C_\ell^{\mathrm{BB}}(r=10^{-3})$",
    color="black",
    linewidth=2,
)
```

**Fix**: Either change figure to match text (r=1) OR change text to match figure (r=0.001). 
**Recommended**: Change figure to r=1 for consistency:

```python
plt.plot(
    ell_range,
    cl_bb_r1 * coeff,  # Remove * 1e-3
    label=r"$C_\ell^{\mathrm{BB}}(r=1)$",  # Change label
    color="black",
    linewidth=2,
)
```

### **Fix 14**: Line 396-397 - Standardize Cluster Notation
**Comment**: `\je{for the notation of the number of clusters}` and `\je{dont you prefer to use notation at the beginnin of section 2.3, e.g. $K_{T_d}$ ? to avoid confusion with the value of Td}`

**File**: `publications/paper/furax_comp_sep.tex`
**Global replacement**:
```latex
# FIND AND REPLACE:
T_d \in [5, 20]     â†’ K_{T_d} \in [5, 20]
\beta_s \in [5, 20] â†’ K_{\beta_s} \in [5, 20]
T_d = 20            â†’ K_{T_d} = 20
\beta_s = 20        â†’ K_{\beta_s} = 20

# In figure captions and labels, use K notation consistently
```
[MY_COMMENT] :

Same as above, it is in file `data/plotting.py`

**Also update figure generation code** in `content/09-R_estimation.py` to use K notation in axis labels. [MY_COMMENT] :  WRONG FILE

# ðŸ”µ TECHNICAL CLARIFICATIONS

## 5. Methodology Explanations

### **Fix 15**: Line 617 - Explain K-means vs Multi-resolution MSE
**Comment**: `\je{do we understand how that can be the case? isn't Kmeans bound to always do better than healpix ?}`

**Current text location**: CMB reconstruction comparison section

**Add explanation after the MSE values**:
```latex
This apparent contradiction occurs because K-means clustering optimizes for overall CMB variance minimization across the entire reconstruction pipeline, which does not necessarily minimize pixel-level mean squared error. The multi-resolution approach, with its regular geometric patches, can achieve lower local reconstruction errors in individual pixels, while K-means clustering achieves better global systematic residual control, leading to improved cosmological parameter estimation despite slightly higher pixel-level residuals.
```

### **Fix 16**: Line 631 - Clarify Optimization Approaches
**Comment**: `\je{but isn't the multiresolution case also obtained by minimizing the variance of the CMB map ?}`

**Add clarification**:
```latex
Note that while both methods aim to minimize reconstruction errors, the multi-resolution approach uses fixed patch configurations determined a priori based on HEALPix downgrading, whereas K-means clustering performs data-driven optimization of patch boundaries to specifically minimize CMB variance across noise realizations.
```

[MY_COMMENT] : no his comment is true this is wrong multi res can also be obtained the same way .. however kmeans provides more granularity and flexibility in patch selection, allowing for better adaptation to local foreground characteristics.

### **Fix 17**: Line 664 - Resolve Contradiction About Noise
**Comment**: `\je{this seems to contradict your earlier observation when you said that K-means was slightly noisier}`

**Current text needs reconciliation** - Review sections discussing K-means noise characteristics and ensure consistency.

**Add clarifying sentence**:
```latex
While K-means shows slightly higher pixel-level noise in individual map reconstructions, it achieves better statistical performance in power spectrum estimation due to superior systematic residual control.
```

# ðŸŸ  STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS

## 6. Content Organization

### **Fix 18**: Line 727 - Remove Repetition
**Comment**: `\je{careful with the repetitions with the conclusions ...}`

**Action**: Review Discussion (Section 6) and Conclusions (Section 7) sections and remove redundant content. Move specific technical results to Discussion and keep only high-level summary in Conclusions.

### **Fix 19**: Line 442-443 - Reorganize Bullet Points
**Comment**: `\je{should these two lines be merged in the two other bullet points on the left? not sure why they are separated at the moment}`

**Current structure** (Sky Region Partitioning):
```latex
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{K-means clustering} is applied to six disjoint subregions...
    \item \textbf{Multi-resolution grouping} is applied separately to...
\end{itemize}
```

**Reorganize as**:
```latex
To probe performance across different foreground regimes, we define distinct sky zones using Planck-based Galactic masks, with different spatial modeling approaches:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{K-means clustering}: Applied to six disjoint subregions, obtained by splitting each mask into upper and lower hemispheric parts: \texttt{GAL020\_U}, \texttt{GAL020\_L}, \texttt{GAL040\_U}, \texttt{GAL040\_L}, \texttt{GAL060\_U}, and \texttt{GAL060\_L}.
    \item \textbf{Multi-resolution grouping}: Applied separately to the full-sky masks: \texttt{GAL020}, \texttt{GAL040}, and \texttt{GAL060}, following the approach used in PTEP (2023).
\end{itemize}
```

### **Fix 20**: Line 551 - Move Beam Effects Discussion
**Comment**: `\je{BEGIN : this should probably go earlier when simulations are detailed}`

**Current location**: Middle of CMB reconstruction comparison
**Move to**: Section describing simulation setup (around line 417 in simulation setup)

### **Fix 21**: Line 464 - Remove Redundant Sentence
**Comment**: `\je{BEGIN : not sure this sentence is necessary?}`

**Consider removing**: "In the adaptive clustering approach, spectral parameters are assigned to pixel clusters defined via spherical K-means"

# ðŸŸ£ MINOR CORRECTIONS

## 7. Citation and Formatting

### **Fix 22**: Line 418 - Fix PySM3 Citation
**Comment**: `\je{je pense que "Group" n'est pas le bon nom pour cette citation}`

**Current citation** likely has:
```latex
~\citep{Panexp_2025,Zonca_2021,Thorne_2017}
```

**Check the bibliography** and ensure proper author names rather than "Group" in the citation:
```bibtex
@article{Zonca_2021,
  title={PySM 3: A Python package for modeling the Galactic microwave sky},
  author={Zonca, Andrea and Singer, Leo P and Lenz, Daniel and others},
  journal={Journal of Open Source Software},
  volume={6},
  number={64},
  pages={3783},
  year={2021}
}
```

### **Fix 23**: Line 560 - Clarify Optimal Clustering
**Comment**: `\je{the optimal pixel clustering -- obtained after minimizing variance?}`

**Current text**:
```latex
Figures~\ref{fig:furax_patches} and~\ref{fig:multires_patches} show the spatial patch layouts produced by each method.
```

**Replace with**:
```latex
Figures~\ref{fig:furax_patches} and~\ref{fig:multires_patches} show the spatial patch layouts produced by each method. For K-means clustering, the patches shown represent the optimal configuration obtained after grid search minimization of CMB reconstruction variance.
```

### **Fix 24**: Line 256 - Update Pipeline Figure Caption
**Comment**: `\je{or other loss function?}`

**Current caption**:
```latex
The variance of the recovered CMB map is used as a selection metric
```

**Replace with**:
```latex
The variance (or other loss function) of the recovered CMB map is used as a selection metric
```

# ðŸ”´ ADDITIONAL STRUCTURAL AND TECHNICAL FIXES

## 8. Text Clarifications

### **Fix 25**: Line 382 - Clarify Reconstruction vs Fit Quality
**Comment**: `\je{not sure what you mean here BEGIN} indicating that improved physical reconstruction aligns with optimal statistical fit \je{END}`

**Current confusing text**:
```latex
indicating that improved physical reconstruction aligns with optimal statistical fit
```

**Replace with**:
```latex
indicating that configurations yielding better physical component reconstruction also achieve higher spectral likelihood values, demonstrating consistency between statistical fit quality and physical modeling accuracy
```

### **Fix 26**: Line 774-775 - Clarify Residual Sensitivity
**Comment**: `\je{BEGIN : not sure what you mean here. Sum(ClBB) is sensitive to residuals in general -- not more statistical than systematics} these metrics can be sensitive to statistical residuals. As a result, they may sometimes overlook systematic residuals. \je{END}`

**Current confusing text**:
```latex
these metrics can be sensitive to statistical residuals. As a result, they may sometimes overlook systematic residuals.
```

**Replace with**:
```latex
while effective proxies for overall residual contamination, these metrics are sensitive to both statistical and systematic residuals equally. The variance-based selection may occasionally favor configurations that achieve lower total residuals primarily through statistical noise reduction rather than systematic foreground suppression.
```

## 9. Future Work and Discussion

### **Fix 27**: Line 728 - Add FGBuster Performance Comparison
**Comment**: `\je{which shows important numerical improvement compared to previous implementations such as fgbuster}`

**Add specific quantitative comparison**:
```latex
Our \texttt{FURAX} implementation demonstrates significant computational improvements over previous frameworks: component separation evaluations that required ~40 minutes per configuration in \texttt{FGBuster} are completed in under 2 minutes with GPU acceleration, representing a speedup factor of >20Ã— for individual fits and enabling the large-scale grid searches presented in this work.
```

### **Fix 28**: Line 729 - Clarify "Learned" Structures
**Comment**: `\je{this sentence is not clear}`

**Current unclear text about "learned spectral patch structures"**:

**Clarify what "learned" means**:
```latex
Our method introduces data-driven spectral patch selection, where clustering configurations are determined through systematic evaluation of reconstruction performance rather than imposed a priori based on geometric considerations.
```

### **Fix 29**: Line 776 - Direct r-fitting Approach
**Comment**: `\je{a better way to address this would be to fit for r directly! and the loss function would be given by r + sigma(r) for instance. In that case, no need to adjust results by hand}`

**Add to future work section**:
```latex
A more direct approach would involve optimizing clustering configurations by directly minimizing the uncertainty on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, using a loss function of the form $L = \hat{r} + \sigma_r$. This would eliminate the intermediate step of variance-based selection and the need for manual adjustment of configurations based on systematic residual thresholds.
```
